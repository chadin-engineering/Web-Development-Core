# Chadin Web Development Core

### Front Words
Chadin, as an internet company, encourages every division within the organization (marketing, legal, etc.) to understand the development of its core product and services. The Web Development Core is a progression of internal curriculums that everyone may follow at their own pace to acquire skills for building an app or web service just like Chadin.

While most of the knowledge in the whole series is technical, we try to provide sufficient amount of examples, analogies and exercises to make the journey more approachable. If you're diligent and follow along the course objectives, you'll by the end have the essential skills to build an internet-based service, and even start a tech company of your own around it.
